Description: Quantum Realm Games Dev Blog

Quantum Realm Games is the world leader in building games with quantum effects at the center of game mechanics.

Our flagship game, [Quantum Chess](https://quantumchess.net), is the worldâ€™s first game to run on a quantum computer.

//The game is truly quantum: moves are expressed as unitary evolutions of a matrix.

In addition to games, we also offer tools and training that enable other studios to build quantum games. Our primary tool, QuantumForge, is a Unity plug-in that allows game developers to quickly define quantum properties on game objects.

If your team is ready to level up to quantum gaming, we offer a class in Quantum Game Design both through [Laguna College of Art and Design](https://lcad.edu), or as a custom engagement with your team.

This blog is a journal of our work and discoveries as we build the future of gaming.
